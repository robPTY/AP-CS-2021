# AP-CS-2021
This repository will contain all of my assignments and projects from the AP Computer Science class that I took back in 2020/2021. Although a majority of these assignments are not difficult, they can help for future learning especially when dealing with Java. Some of the most notable are binary search, encryption, etc. The IDE used for all these projects was BlueJ.

The following format for each folder will be:

| Module #    |
